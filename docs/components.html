          <li>In general, links <em>go places</em>, while <a href="#component-button">buttons</a>
            <em>do things</em>. The difference is that buttons change the state
            of the website. That can be on the server side or the client side,
            but a button implies that some action is being taken, and something,
            somewhere is different now. Links take you somewhere else, but
            neither the place you were nor the place you&rsquo;re going have
            changed when you do so.</li>
          <li>Yes, buttons are routinely abused to work as just bigger, more
            prominent links &mdash; usually along with other bad design
            decisions that visually mark almost all of the items on a page as
            the most important thing, creating frustration and increasing the
            user&rsquo;s cognitive load. It&rsquo;s a terrible practice, and
            just because it&rsquo;s common is no reason to do it.</li>
          <li>In places where you might be tempted to use a button to go
            somewhere because the link should be visually prominent, consider
            using the <a href="#component-prominent-link">prominent link</a>
            component instead.</li>
          <li>If you need to present the user with a prominent decision point
            when hen could go to any of several different places, and each one
            calls for some significant explanation, you might consider the
            <a href="#component-panel">panel link</a> component.</li>

        <h2>Panel Link</h2>
        <div class="example">
          <a href="#component-panel" class="panel">
            <p>You can use any block-level elements you like inside the panel,
              including paragraphs, lists, and headings.</p>

          <li>This component is best used for a menu that takes up most or all of
            a page (like <a href="index.html">the homepage for this design system</a>).</li>
          <li>The panel is designed to work with secondary, tertiary, and quarternary
            headings (<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> and
            <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>), but not primary headings (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>).
            Each page should have only one primary heading, so if you&rsquo;re considering
            using it in a panel, you might be using the wrong component.</li>
          <li>Since the entire panel is a link, don&rsquo;t use any other links or buttons
            inside the panel.</li>
